Snake Game 90s!!

I wanted to create a classic 90s game that started it all with a mobile device, and that was Snake! I fell in love with the game as a teenager and still do as a grown adult. The game is fun, makes you use your navigation skills to maneuver tight turns and corners, and makes you want to achieve a higher score if you fail the first time. The snake game can help a person guide themself in the outside world when dealing with difficult situations at home, school, or work; it can lead them to a better victory in the end, but if they fail the first time, they will always have a second chance to overcome to any obstacle and flourish.
